# Tagline for JanibandSnaily

BEHOLD YOUR GOD, SNAILY

# What is JanibandSnaily?

JanibandSnaily is a comical spin-off of CitizenFX's Snaily bots for their Discord guild. This was made just to have fun
for the people who get banned and adamantly urge others that their ban was unfair. The bot has witty responses depending
on what you say, ranging from taunts to even singing! (Albeit very budget singing) Along with responses supporting the spoiler
tag system included in Discord.

# What is Janiband?

Janiband is a group of friends, created after witnessing a lot of individuals incessantly complaining about being banned 
in the Cfx.re Project Hub Discord guild, with "Jani band" being a very funny and popular typo among the non-English speakers.
This group is only meant to be comical and we mean no offense or harm to anyone mentally/physically.
